# GitHub Diff Filter for Chrome

Allows user to filter out certain diffs by filename.
Button allows to toggle the filter on and off.

Built just because I was getting annoyed scrolling through diffs for files that were automatically generated/changed. 

Disclaimer: Pretty fragile code that will likely break if GitHub decides to switch up class/id names.
